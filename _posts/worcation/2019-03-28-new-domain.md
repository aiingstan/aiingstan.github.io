Today when I was reading [this post](https://medium.com/@glmdev/creating-the-ultimate-free-personal-website-d2ae3db177e2), the term `Google Domains` caught my attention. Although I've bought several domains before, I never got a satisfying domain name for personal use. So I followed the lead and bought a domain from `Google Domains`, and finished the DNS configuration. Have to say, the whole process is quite delightful.

I even tried the `Email forwarding` feature, which basically redirects all emails from `xxx@YOUR.DOMAIN` to whatever email address you usually use. It reminds me that I can configure any fake email address under my domain for purpose of bug reporting, and redirect them to my daily use email. I can then unsubscribe to those reportings by deleting the forwarding record, ASESOME!
